If anyone sees her or is able to free her from Hades, please, please come return her to me. My life will never be the same without her and half a year isn't enough time with my daughter. It would take two years for me to actually see her for one whole year. I miss Persephone so much. 
                  <p>Come to Mount Olympus immediately if there is information about her that I don't already know.</p>
